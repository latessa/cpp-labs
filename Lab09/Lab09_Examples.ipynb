    "## The Number of Operations in Addition and Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "When programming, we typically think of additional and multiplication as single operations that complete in constant time. However, this assumes that the numbers being added or multiplied fit within the fixed size of standard data types (like `int` or `float`). When working with very large numbers (e.g., thousands or millions of digits), it becomes important to consider how the number of operations scales as length $n$ grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $n$ be the number of digits (base 10) or bits (base 2) in the inputs. Then the running times are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Addition: $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ — linear time.\n",
    "- Multiplication (grade‑school): $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ — quadratic time (each digit of one operand is multiplied by each digit of the other).\n",

    "  6359\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of single-digit additions is linear to the number of digits $n$. We could iterate over the digits from right to left, and a single loop would execute $n$ times. Even if there is a carry, it only requires a constant amount of extra work per digit, so the loop doesn't have to repeat any extra times. Addition can be performed in a single pass over the length.\n",

    "The number of single-digit multiplications is quadratic to the number of digits $n$. Each digit of one operand is multiplied by each digit of the other operand. If each operand has $n$ digits, there are $n \\times n = n^2$ single-digit multiplications. Thus, the running time is $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. If writing a program, nested loops would be used to multiply each digit of both operands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addition is also involved in multiplication, but because addition is asymptotically faster, the multiplication step dominates the overall running time, resulting in a total time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2 + n) = \\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.\n",

    "\n",
