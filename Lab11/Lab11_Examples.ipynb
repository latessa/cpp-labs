    "A **tree** is a special type of graph that has the following properties:\n",
    "- It is connected, meaning there is a path between any two nodes.\n",
    "- It has no cycles, meaning there is no way to start at a node and follow a path that leads back to the same node.\n",
    "- It has a designated root node, which is the topmost node in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside, a tree's roots are at the bottom, and they branch upward. Trees as a data structure are the opposite: the root is at the top, and the branches extend downward.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **binary tree** is a type of tree where each node has at most two children, a left child and a right child. Binary trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a simple binary tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "        A\n",
    "       / \\\n",
    "      B   C\n",
    "     / \\   \\\n",
    "    D   E   F\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **binary search tree**, the left child of a node contains a value less than its parent node, and the right child contains a value greater than its parent node. This makes it easy to find values on average in $\\mathcal{O}(log~n)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike with arrays, where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, trees are typically represented using nodes that contain data and pointers. The data part holds the value that the node means to store, and the points link to other nodes in the tree. In a binary tree, each node will likely have two points, one to each child. This allows the tree to be traversed from root down to the leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a tree can also have a pointer to its parent node, which allows traversal from child to parent. In our Huffman Tree implementation, we will start with child nodes, and we will connect them by creating a common parent node.\n",
