    "A **tree** is a special type of graph that has the following properties:\n",
    "- It is connected, meaning there is a path between any two nodes.\n",
    "- It has no cycles, meaning there is no way to start at a node and follow a path that leads back to the same node.\n",
    "- It has a designated root node, which is the topmost node in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside, a tree's roots are at the bottom, and they branch upward. Trees as a data structure are the opposite: the root is at the top, and the branches extend downward.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **binary tree** is a type of tree where each node has at most two children, a left child and a right child.\n",
    "\n",

    "Unlike with arrays, where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, trees are typically represented using nodes that contain data and pointers. The node's data field holds the value stored by the node, and the pointers link to other nodes in the tree. In a binary tree, each node will typically have two pointers, one to each child. This allows the tree to be traversed from the root down to the leaves.\n",
