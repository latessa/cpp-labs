    "In today lab, we will discuss bubble sort and analyze its time complexity in terms of Big-0, Big-Ω, and Big-Θ notation. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It is known as a comparison-based sorting algorithm, which relies on comparing elements to determine their correct order."
